This is a simple web-based implementation of the classic Hangman game. The game is built using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript and incorporates essential programming concepts such as arrays, iterators, DOM manipulation, event listeners, and string manipulation.

How to Play
A word is randomly chosen and displayed as underscores (_).
Click the letter buttons or use your keyboard to guess a letter.
Each incorrect guess adds a part to the hangman diagram.
Win the game by guessing all the letters before the diagram is complete.
Lose the game if the diagram is completed before guessing the word.
Use the "Play Again" button to start a new game.
